In the last set of exercises, you prepared and explored the data for the case study of portfolio risk management. Now, let’s get to the heart of the leading investment management firm’s key problem. The problem is that they need to choose a specific mix of assets based on their specific investment goal. And, that’s where the portfolio optimization method that we are going to learn is very useful.

## Portfolio Risk Management and Optimization

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "73795bf38e"
```

`@part1`
{{Portfolio risk management is about:

 Categorizing a set of investment opportunities based on the risk and returns

Choosing the mix of investment to achieve a firm's desired risk-return trade-offs}}


`@part2`
{{Portfolio Optimization is:

One of the risk management methods to choose this mix of investment with a goal of maximizing a measure for portfolio’s return contingent on a measure for a portfolio’s risk.}}


`@script`
Portfolio Risk Management generally involves categorizing a set of investment opportunities, for example, set of equities, or securities, and based on the and returns. And, then this involves choosing the mix of investments that achieve the firm's targeted objectives in terms of the desired risk and return trade-offs. Portfolio optimization is one of these risk management methods used by investment managers to choose the right mix of investment or the right proportion of various assets to be held in a portfolio with a goal of maximizing a measure or proxy measure for portfolio’s return contingent on a measure or a proxy for a portfolio’s risk.

## Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Optimization 

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a2aca93f46"
```

`@part1`
`n_Portfolios = 25000`

`results = np.zeros((3,n_Portfolios))`

`for i in range(n_Portfolios):

    weights = np.random.random(n_Assets)
    weights /= np.sum(weights)


    preturn, pvar = calcPortPerf(weights, meanDailyReturn, covariance)

    results[0,i] = preturn*numPeriodsAnnually
    results[1,i] = pvar*np.sqrt(numPeriodsAnnually)
    results[2,i] = (results[0,i] - riskFreeRate)/results[1,i]`


`@script`
One of the popular ways of portfolio optimization is the Monte Carlo Method. The idea here is to carry out repeated trials using randomly generated inputs, and observing the outputs. In our case study of portfolio optimization, with this simple code described on the slide here, we carried out repeated trials. We generated 25000 different portfolios with the different randomly generated weights assigned to the set of equities and observed risk, return and risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio) as outcomes for these portfolios. We recorded these outcomes in a data frame named results.  In this way, the code here quickly generated random numbers and enabled us to observe the outcomes from complex scenarios.

Now, let’s visualize the results-dataframe we just created, and we can see here that changing weights of each asset in the portfolio can have a dramatic effect on the level of risk and expected return. In our case study, for the same target return of 12%, volatility can range from about 11% to 18%. And, therefore, it is important to be thoughtful while choosing how much weight each asset in the portfolio should carry. In this plot, we can see that a target return can be achieved with a range of different risk levels. And, the portfolios furthest to the left for each expected return are the set of portfolios that achieve a given return with the minimum amount of risks for that return and are called efficient frontier.
