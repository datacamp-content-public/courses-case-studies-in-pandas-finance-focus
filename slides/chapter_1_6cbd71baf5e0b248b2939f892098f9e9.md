In the last set of exercises, you prepared and explored the data for the case study of portfolio risk management. Now, let’s get to the heart of the leading investment management firm’s key problem. The problem is that they need to choose a specific mix of Stocks based on their specific investment goal. And, that’s where the portfolio optimization method that we are going to learn is very useful.

## Portfolio Risk Management and Optimization

`@part1`
**Portfolio Risk Management** 

 Categorizing a set of investment opportunities based on the risk and returns

Choosing the mix of investment to achieve a firm's desired risk-return trade-offs


`@part2`
**Portfolio Optimization** 

One of the risk management methods to choose this mix of investment 

The goal is to maximize a measure for portfolio’s return contingent on a measure for a portfolio’s risk.


`@script`
Portfolio Risk Management generally involves categorizing a set of investment opportunities, for example, set of equities, or securities, and based on the and returns. And, then this involves choosing the mix of investments that achieve the firm's targeted objectives in terms of the desired risk and return trade-offs. Portfolio optimization is one of these risk management methods used by investment managers to choose the right mix of investment or the right proportion of various assets to be held in a portfolio with a goal of maximizing a measure or proxy measure for portfolio’s return contingent on a measure or a proxy for a portfolio’s risk.

## Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Optimization

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a2aca93f46"
```

`@part1`
#Run Monte Carlo Simulation of n_Portfolios portfolios

n_Portfolios = 100000 {{1}}

results = np.zeros((3,n_Portfolios)){{2}}

numStocks = len(stocks){{3}}


`@script`
One of the popular ways of portfolio optimization is the Monte Carlo Method. The idea here is to carry out repeated trials using randomly generated inputs, and observing the outputs. In our case study of portfolio optimization, with this simple code described on the slide here, we carried out repeated trials. We generated 25000 different portfolios with the different randomly generated weights assigned to the set of equities and observed risk, return and risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio) as outcomes for these portfolios. We recorded these outcomes in a data frame named results.  In this way, the code here quickly generated random numbers and enabled us to observe the outcomes from complex scenarios.

`@part1`
#Calculate portfolios

for i in range(n_Portfolios):

    weights = np.random.random(numStocks)
    weights /= np.sum(weights)

   

    p_returns, p_volatality = calcPortfolioPerf(weights, meanDailyReturn, covariance)


    results[0,i] = p_returns*numPeriodsAnnually
    results[1,i] = p_volatality*np.sqrt(numPeriodsAnnually)
    results[2,i] = (results[0,i] - riskFreeRate)/results[1,i]

plt.grid(True){{2}}

plt.xlabel('Expected Portfolio Volatility'){{2}}

plt.ylabel('Expected Portfolio Returns'){{3}}

plt.colorbar(label='Sharpe Ratio'){{4}}
