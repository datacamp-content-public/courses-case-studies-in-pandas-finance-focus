In the last set of exercises, you explored the data for the case study of Investment portfolio risk management and learnt about the basic measures of portfolio performance in general. Now, let’s get to the heart of the investment firm’s key problem. The problem is that they need to choose a specific mix of Stocks based on their investment goal. And, that’s where the portfolio risk management and optimization method that we are going to learn is very useful.

`@script`
Portfolio Risk Management generally involves categorizing a set of investment opportunities, for example, set of equities, or securities, and based on the risk and returns. And, then this involves choosing the mix of investments that achieve the firm's targeted objectives in terms of the desired risk and return trade-offs. Portfolio optimization is one of these risk management methods used by investment managers to choose the right mix of investment or the right proportion of various assets to be held in a portfolio with a goal of maximizing a measure or proxy measure for portfolio’s return contingent on a measure or a proxy for a portfolio’s risk.

One of the popular ways of portfolio optimization is the Monte Carlo Method. This method is named for the city Monte Carlo in Monaco, which is known for its casinos.

Monte Carlo simulations are methods of probability analysis used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models. The idea here is to carry out repeated trials using randomly generated inputs, and observing the outputs. 
So, let's get started with defining variables.
In our case study, let's generate 100000 imaginary portfolios with a different combination of the stocks. So let's create a variable n_portfolio and assign it the value of 100000. And, create a data frame results to store the three output variables related to portfolio performance. The result Dataframe has three columns and 100000 rows filled with zeros. And, let's create a variable numStock to indicate the number of stocks in the portfolio, which is the same as the length of the array stocks.

#Monte Carlo Simulation: Generate Portfolio Weights and Calculate Portfolio Performance

```
for i in range(n_Portfolios):

    weights = np.random.random(numStocks)
    p_weights = weights/ np.sum(weights)

   

    p_returns, p_volatality = calcPortPerf(p_weights, meanDailyReturn, covariance)


    results[0,i] = p_returns*numPeriodsAnnually
    results[1,i] = p_volatality*np.sqrt(numPeriodsAnnually)
    results[2,i] = (results[0,i] - riskFreeRate)/results[1,i]
```


`@script`
In our case study of portfolio optimization, with this simple code described on the slide here, we carried out repeated trials and generated 100000 different portfolios with the different randomly generated weights assigned to the four stocks we selected.

We generated random numbers corresponding to the numbers of stocks that are four in our case. And, calculated p_wight, a variable for portfolio weights.

Next, we calculated portfolio returns and portfolio volatility using the function calcPortperf that we previously created.
 
Then in the first column of the results Dataframe, let's record average annual portfolio returns, in the second column let's record portfolio volatility or risk and in the third column we let's record the risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio)

## Portfolio Visualization

#Monte Carlo Simulation:Visualizing Portfolios' Performance
```
plt.scatter(results[1,:], results[0,:], c=results[2,:], marker='o')

plt.grid(True)

plt.xlabel('Expected Portfolio Volatility')

plt.ylabel('Expected Portfolio Returns')

plt.colorbar(label='Sharpe Ratio')

plt.title('Visualization of Stock Portfolios Generated with MC Method')
```


`@script`
Now, let’s visualize the results-dataframe we just created. It is important to have grid, x-label, y label, color-coding for sharpe ratio so that our visualization is meaningful and understandable.

`@script`
We can see here that changing weights of each asset in the portfolio can have a dramatic effect on the level of risk and expected return. In our case study, for the same target return of 12%, volatility can range from about 11% to 18%. And, therefore, it is important to be thoughtful while choosing how much weight each asset in the portfolio should carry. In this plot, we can see that a target return can be achieved with a range of different risk levels. And, the portfolios furthest to the left for each expected return are the set of portfolios that achieve a given return with the minimum amount of risks for that return and are called efficient frontier. And the yellow color dots indicate the portfolios that provide very high risk adjusted returns.
